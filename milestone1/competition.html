                    Content - Has a bar at the top that immediately provides contact
                    information. I don’t love where it’s placed but I do like that it
                    is accessible easily. Has the normal navigation bar. I do enjoy
                    that, it makes it easy to find.

                    Images - Photos are emotionally provoking. That’s a good feature.
                    Also has a bar showing what kind of work that they do. Nice.

                    Color Scheme - Red, white, and grey. Felt pretty neutral with a pop of color.
                </dd>
                <br>
                <dd>Layout - Very blocky. Like one block per screen.</dd>

                    Content - Has a nav bar that disappears as you move the screen. Don’t
                    love. All of the contact information first in a way that reminds me of
                    a document. Not a fan. Shows some of the customer reviews, I do really
                    like that. Shows you what kind of windows they support. Love that!

                    Images - Showing what they provide. Has pictures with smiling previous
                    customers, pulls the emotional card.

                <dd>
                    Color Scheme - Blue, black, and white. A bit of a darker neutral tone. Was
                    appealing to the eye.

                    Layout - Felt like I was looking at a document for the top half of the screen.
                    Was extremely confused to find the that the rest of the page looked
                    quite great.
