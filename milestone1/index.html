            <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
            <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>The website will display my uncle's business. He sells and repairs window screens.</p>
            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>
                I will most likely ask for a lot of the pictures and text directly from my uncle.
                I might pull some pictures from his previous website as well. If I need something
                else that neither can provide, I will look through creative commons.
            </p>
            <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>
                They might get pretty bloody confused if they're looking for a website
                that sells smoothies only to find one that sells window screens. So
                the context of the website is quite important to keep in mind.
            </p>
            <h4>What would you like useers to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>I want them to buy my uncle's window screens.</p>
            <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>To help make my uncle's website to look more professional than it does now.</p>
