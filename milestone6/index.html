                    <h2>Tom K.</h2>
                    <p>Curtis came to my house in Eagle Mountain when the builder was having a problem with my patio
                        screen. The patio screen he installed is very solid, the best screen door I've ever had. Curtis
                        was professional, friendly and very knowledgeable. He noticed my actual glass patio door wasn't
                        installed correctly and fixed that while installing the new screen. Highly recommend him.</p>

                    <h2>Lynda P.</h2>
                    <p>We needed our slider screen door repaired. We didn't want to worry about taking out the door and
                        transporting it and then leaving it at a shop for 2 weeks. We called Curtis and he came to us.
                        He fixed our door and and a window screen. Reasonable price and done in 45 minutes. Thanks
                        Curtis!</p>

                    <p>Fast, friendly, efficient and reasonably priced. What more could you ask for? Thank you for the
                        prompt and friendly service. I would highly recommend him.</p>

                    <p>Utah Window Screens is fantastic and I would recommend them to anyone. Their prices are great and
                        the quality of workmanship is fantastic! They replaced our sliding screen door, and three other
                        window screens. Curtis showed up right on time and was finished with all 4 in less than an hour
                        and a half. He was able to use the frames that we had for the sliding door and one of the
                        upstairs windows. The other two screens were missing completely and he was able to fabricate
                        high quality frames. I will definitely be calling Curtis again if we have any other screen
                        issues.</p>
